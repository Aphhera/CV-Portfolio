                <h4>Video Games</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>I really enjoy rts and real time strategy games, i think they really make you figure out and think through solutions but in real time which makes it both stressful and satisfying almost like a puzzle, which might be why I really enjoy coding!</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Reading and Writing</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I have always enjoyed reading and get through fantasy and sci-fi books at an alarming rate, and have got a couple recommendations for you!</li>
                    </ul>
                   
                <h4>Drawing and Art</h4>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>             
                <h4>Para-Ice Hockey</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I recently joined a para-ice hockey team and its a really fun passtime that isnt all that well known, if you want to have a go ill see you on the ice!</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>I really just enjoy learning new skills </h4>

                        <li>I recently learnt how to embroider but my stitch lines arent quite good enough to show yet!</li>
                    </ul>
