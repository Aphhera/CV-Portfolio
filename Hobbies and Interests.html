                    <p class="info">I really enjoy rts and real time strategy games, i think they really make you figure out and think through solutions but in real time which makes it both stressful and satisfying almost like a puzzle, which might be why I really enjoy coding! </p>
                <li>Reading and Writing</li>
                    <p class="info">I have always enjoyed reading and get through fantasy and sci-fi books at an alarming rate, and have got a couple recommendations for you!</p>

                <li>I really just enjoy learning new skills </li>
