                    <p>I really enjoy rts and real time strategy games, i think they really make you figure out and think through solutions but in real time which makes it both stressful and satisfying almost like a puzzle, which might be why I really enjoy coding! </p>

                    <p>I have always enjoyed reading and get through fantasy and sci-fi books at an alarming rate, and have got a couple recommendations for you!</p>
